			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.
When the program tries to access the memory for some data and discover that is
not there a system call occurs. In the system call, a hash table called
supplemental page table checks the user virtual page address as a key to find
if any supplemental page entry matches the required user virtual address. If
they do than the easy loading process is started, by loading the
information into the memory from a file or from a swap. Both of these cases
are covered by the same function. 

>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?
We implemented a lock in the system to avoid this sort of race condition.
There are lock for the access of the frame table, supplemental page table and
swap table to avoid this sort of issue.
---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?
We used hash table for the supplemental page table due to its versatility and
speed. For the swap table we used bitmap since it fits perfectly with the case
of finding empty sectors within the block, and also since its fast and simple.
For the frame table we used a list since it is a global structure (only one
frame table in the entire pintos).
		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.
When no frame can be allocated palloc_get_page will return a NULL pointer, and
this will trigger in our code the call of a function named
evict_frame_entry.This function will find a page to be evicted based on the
dirty condition (if it is accessd or not). To avoid the evict_frame_entry
getting stuck, we put a limiter to how many times it can run a full loop
between the frames to decide what to evict. If the limiter reachs its value,
then a random frame is chosen to be evicted.

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?
We have a flag on the supplemental page table entry that tells where that data
is. It can be on the file, page table (already on memory) or in a swap. When
the frame is evicted the data will be moved to the swap table 

>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)
Deadlock is a situation where one process cannot obtain a lock because it is
waiting from a lock of another process that is waiting for a lock from the
first process,causing the system to just stay stall. In our case we avoided
this situation by making sure that the lock was just accessed statically by
the functions that are being called by the page_fault. The only lock that can
be accessed from one thread to another is the one from the supplmental page
table, which is called when the process is exiting to remove all the
supplemental page entries from it and consequently frame page entry.

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?
We have a lock on each thread to make sure that this situation does not
happen. In order to delete a frame that is being held by a process, our lock
system requires one thread (the process thread) to get the frame lock from the
owner of the frame. In this way, when the lock is requested, the data from Q
is moved to the swap and it cannot access it until the lock is released

>> B7: Suppose a page fault in process P causes a page to be read from
>> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q
>> cannot interfere by e.g. attempting to evict the frame while it is
>> still being read in?
We use a lock whenever something has to be written from the file, swap and
into the memory, therefore avoiding situations like this.

>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur
>> during system calls.  Do you use page faults to bring in pages (as
>> in user programs), or do you have a mechanism for "locking" frames
>> into physical memory, or do you use some other design?  How do you
>> gracefully handle attempted accesses to invalid virtual addresses?
The page_fault function on exception.c will not perform any action itself,
everything is done by functions that run outside of the exception.c program.
When the page_fault occurs, the virtual address that was trying to be accessed
is used a key to a hash table that is the supplmental page table. When a page
table entry is found, than a function to load the data into memory (either
from file or swap, which will be determined by a flag) is called, and then the
program can run normally. If the virtual address cannot be found on the hash
table, than the system will just fault as normally without any action.
---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: A single lock for the whole VM system would make
>> synchronization easy, but limit parallelism.  On the other hand,
>> using many locks complicates synchronization and raises the
>> possibility for deadlock but allows for high parallelism.  Explain
>> where your design falls along this continuum and why you chose to
>> design it this way.
Our system follows in the latter category, since we implemented locks for the
supplemental page table, frame page table and swap page table.Deadlock is
avoided by calling those locks only on static functions and in an orderly way,
therefore no unexpected call to them can occur. We also implemented time
conditions on some of the functions, so if the process gets stuck on it, it
will leave yield after some time, releasing any locks and therefore avoiding
deadlocks entirely.
			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

---- RATIONALE ----
